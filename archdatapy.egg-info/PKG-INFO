# ArchDataPy

**ArchDataPy** is a lightweight Python package designed to access and work with archaeological datasets from the R `archdata` package in Python. It provides tools to download the data directly from CRAN, extract the datasets, and load them as `pandas` DataFrames for easy analysis and manipulation.

## Features

- **Download datasets** from the R `archdata` package without needing R installed.
- **Load datasets** directly into Python as `pandas` DataFrames using `pyreadr`.
- Provides an efficient and Pythonic way to access widely used archaeological datasets.

## Installation

You can install `ArchDataPy` by cloning the repository and installing it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/archdatapy.git
cd archdatapy
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

This package requires the following Python libraries:

    requests
    pyreadr
    pandas

These dependencies are automatically installed when you install the package.

## Usage

1. Download and Extract Datasets

The get_archdata function downloads and extracts datasets from the R archdata package. It returns a dictionary where each key is a dataset name and each value is the path to the .rda file for that dataset.

from archdatapy import get_archdata

2. Download datasets and get file paths
file_paths = get_archdata()
print(file_paths)  # View the available datasets and their paths

3. Load a Specific Dataset

The load_archdata function takes the path to an .rda file and loads it as a pandas DataFrame (or multiple DataFrames, depending on the dataset). This function wraps around pyreadr to simplify loading R data files in Python.

```python
from archdatapy import load_archdata

# Load a specific dataset
dataset_name = 'YourDatasetName'  # Replace with an actual dataset name from file_paths keys
data = load_archdata(file_paths[dataset_name])
print(data)  # View the loaded dataset
```
